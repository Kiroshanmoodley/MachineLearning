							<!-- Section 1 - Unit Learnings -->
							<p>Seminar on future of machine learning was held and focussed on Industry 4.0, the Internet of things, and big data. Industry 4.0 has always been a passion for me, 
							having come from an automation and control field and designing many plants to have expandability for Industry 4.0. I have included an interesting link below to the history and future of 
							Industry 4.0<br /><p>

							Some of the biggest concerns I feel are present is security of data. Especially with algorithms, data can be hacked, training data manipulated, breached and sensitive information taken. It is an aspect machine learning 
							practitioners seldomly focus on, but a huge concern with methods such as IoT relying on ethernet, and the internet in many cases. With IoT most data is collected remotely, sometimes geographically remotely,
							and stream to cloud servers. This data can be intercepted and variables changed which can cause massive problems with the predictive ability of algorithms.<br />
							
							<h2>Final thoughs on team work</h2>
							
							The experience of working in a team has ultimately been fun. The contributions of myself, I feel, have moved the team forward. It is great to have a member of the team who questions the rationale of the teams
							decisions, and that makes everyone, including me think about the direction we are following. We have had issues with timeousness, but we do all residfe in different timezones, and we have differing 
							problems in those timezones. South Africa experiences electricity outages, and Mubarak in Nigeria also has problems with network and large distances he travels to and from work. Despite these, we have been able
							to successfully complete both assignments, whether we could makes meetings, or converse on mail, we have made the assignments work. These are experiences I will take into the work setting, and into my career forward.
