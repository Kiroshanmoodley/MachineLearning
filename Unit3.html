							<!-- Section 1 - Unit Learnings -->
							<p>In Unit 3, the final summary of the discussion on Artificial Intelligence was posted by all students. Many of my peers agreed that AI in the long run will prove to be a source of insight, and change the way humans work with big data. My summary post discussed potential improvements AI will bring, and the need for humans to move to more complex roles once AI replaces repetetive tasks:<br /><p>
							<p>Summary Post:<br /><br />Many very good discussion points have been raised by my colleagues which encompass a wide variety of uses from detection of human emotion to automated drones.<br /><br />
							While some uses for AI are low risk, such as in chatbots, some uses are of much higher risk, such as control systems on autonomous vehicles (Semmler & Rose, 2017) or AI algorithms used to detect human disease. Currently, there are no widely adopted laws governing liability of these systems if they generate harm (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2109). In 2018 an autonomous vehicle fatally collided with a cyclist in Arizona, Tuscon, which resulted in Uber having to suspend all further testing of these vehicles (Wakabayashi, 2018).<br /><br />
							Following on the above, (Leslie, 2019) give a project execution plan and state that that the model should be explicable, meaning there should be an explainable account of the rationale behind each specific outcome.<br /><br />
							In our discussion group another consideration of interest was biased outputs of the system. (Ellahham, 2109) shows how AI reciprocates training data and can adopt biases in the training data through to the operational dataset, even if unintentional.<br /><br />
							A further consideration mentioned in our discussions is security of these systems if confronted with adversarial attack (Leslie, 2019). This could be to expose sensitive private information, or to poison the data the AI systems ingests, to unknowingly result in undesirable reinforcement learning behavior.<br /><br />
							Finally, many discussion points have been made on job displacement. Opinions vary on the subject, but consensus amongst academics holds that AI will lead to job enhancement rather than job displacement (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2109), though I strongly believe there will be an initial period of job displacement as humans learn to assume more complex roles.<br /><br />
							In conclusion, there is much investment in AI due to the opportunities AI presents for economic development currently. As cited in (West & Allen, 2018), a report from PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimates a 14% or $15.7 trillion increase in global GDP by 2030 from the adoption of AI technologies. With uses in fields such as transportation, criminal justice, online security, chatbots, and health care to name a few, it is certainly an interesting time to be involved with AI.<br /><br />
