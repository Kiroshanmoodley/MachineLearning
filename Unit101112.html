							<!-- Section 1 - Unit Learnings -->
							<p>Hi  colleagues<p>
							<p>Units 10, 11 and 12 prepared the class for the final assignment due at the end of the module.<br /><br />
							Unit 10's reading centred on (Raschka S, 2018) and discussed various concepts such as validation and hold out methods, stratifcation, class balance, hyperparmater optimisation. I have in my final assignment submission used a few of these learnings
							such as the StratifiedRemoveFolds function to select the 3rd fold of ten for training, and supplied fold 7 of 10 to test the Multi-layer perceptron I used in the assignment. This journal article was an invaluable tool for my final submission.
							The initial outline was submitted in unit 10, and was well accepted for the final assignment.<br /><br />
							
							Unit 11 contained a final seminar which I felt was of particular interest. Confusion matrices were discussed and expanded to the performance measures of Precision and Recall, and importantly, the F-Measure which is the harmonic mean
							of a models precision and recall values and a good measure of system performance, which I have used in my assignment to interrogate the different models I have used.<br /><br />
							
							This preparatory work enabled me to start my essay with ease. The biggest problem encountered in the essay was the size of the dataset, selected from an empirical study in Portugal for empirical data collected to assess respondents for a term loan, the dataset was 45211 instances. This was laboroius to work with using SVM's and multi-layer perceptrons.
							This was not made easier by using SMOTE as it generated approximately 35000 synthetic instances. To get a balance of computing cost and accuracy, the data was split into 10 folds and two randomly selected as training and test. This approach worked well
							to allow the algorithm to build the model in acceptable timeframes compared to the initial 45 minutes it took with the original dataset size.<p>
