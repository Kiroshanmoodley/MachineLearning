							<!-- Section 1 - Unit Learnings -->
							<p>Hi  colleagues<p>
							<p>Unit 5 tool a deep dive into a few popular AI algorithms:<br />
							- Decision trees<br />
							Some advantages of decision trees, as seen in (Bell, 2020) are ease of visualising the tree structure (which enhances the understanding of the decisions made), little need for data preparation, and little processing power required.
							Very few disadvantages exist, though the algorithm can create very complex trees if the input data entered is complex.<br /><br />
														
							- Clustering<br />
							The k-means algorithm works by assigning a random number of custer centroids (k), and then calculating the square of the Euclidean distance of each data point to the closest cluster centroid to form the clusters.
							The algorithm re-iterates this operation, moving the cluster centroid until the sum of squares for each member of the cluster is the lowest. Clustering is an unsupervised method.<br /><br />
							
							- Association Rules<br />
							Association rules learning (Bell, 2020) is an unsupervised machine learning method which tests for reliance of one element data on another element of data. Association rules work by calculating support, 
							confidence, lift and conviction variables to find the relation of a element to the rest. Uses of association rules learning are primarily in customer shopping behavior, and which purchases are usually seen with others (Basket analysis).
							Common algorithms include Apriori and FP-Growth.<br /><br />
							
							- Support Vector Machines<br />
							Support vector mahines are also another class of unsupervised learning algorithm. They are used for a variety of classification taaks, such as image recognition and pattern recognition (Bell, 2020). Support vestors use
							hyperplanes to segment the data in a feature space (using the kernel method) into different classifications/groups. Uses are frequently in to medical field with image and pattern recognititon, but this algorithm is very robust and
							is best for any image or pattern recognition task.<br /><br /><p>				
														
							<h2>Seminar 4</h2>
							<p>Seminar 4 was also held in this week, Introducing and re-inforcing students knowledge on Unsupervised, Re-inforcement, Supervised, and -supervised learning. A case study on diease detection on leaves was discussed. Some algorithm types for this tasks were
							interrogated, such as Naive Bayes, Ramdom Forests, and Support Vector Machines. We learned that no one model is best for every problem and data set, and much work in testing needs to first be done to find
							the best tool for the task at hand<p>
