							<!-- Section 1 - Unit Learnings -->
							<p>Hi  colleagues<p>
							<p>In Unit 8, a seminar on classification and regression was held. In this seminar, raw data of breast cancer patients was presented. This gave the class an idea of the data structure itself. We also got to interrogate how an .arff for WEKA is structured.<br />
							We also ran the data through pre-preparations steps to build a csv or arff file. Discussion summary 2 is also due in this week as below<br />
							
							<h2>My summary post:<br /><br /></h2>
							<p>Many pertinent discussion points have been made by my peers, of which I fully agree with. One of the biggest questions of our age is how close could machines capabilities get to, in comparison with that of humans? <br /><br />
							Nabeel discussed virtual personal assistants and the ethical guidelines which must be entrenched for there use and many others, which is a major part of many academic authors works, such as (Leslie, 2019), from the Turing Institute Public Policy Programme, who stresses the ethical obligations of AI.
							Mubarak has shown some of the large real-world data, which I have also seen in (Basset, et al., 2018), stating YouTube must analyze 4 million views per day, and generate personalized suggestions based on the content of the views. <br /><br />
							Lakshmi’s views are echoed in several sectors which use machine learning algorithms, such as in radiology for the detection of terminal diseases. (Thrall, et al., 2018) show that there are many benefits for using AI (which apply to many other industries), such as achieving better outcomes for patients at a fraction of the cost. Moreover, this scan analysis can be done on demand, meaning they are immediately accessible when urgent or life-threatening conditions are present, without having to wait for consultations and specialist time. (Thrall, et al., 2018) lists a few pertinent points which is that of observer fatigue, an unavoidable aspect of radiology, which extends to many other industries and functions, for which AI can assist in ensuring that finding true positive conditions remains high.<br /><br />
							Vasilisa has made mention of the number of models required for a set of pre-processing steps (With some great diagrams :-). The advances made in computing have been exponential, to the point where one wonders when mankind would saturate our advances in technology. A brilliant article in Forbes, (Intel AI BRANDVOICE, 2018) interviews Richard Mark Soley (Ph.D, executive director of the Industrial Internet Consortium) who recalls working on speech recognition 35 years ago, and states that at the time, computers were able to do a satisfactory job, able to convert speech sometimes, and cost a few million dollars. In comparison, what was thought of as supercomputers at that time are inside smartphones today, with more processing and memory capability. Today’s latest chips from Intel can run over 10 trillion calculations per second, and apart from raw power, are being optimized to carry out many AI based math problems faster by utilizing strategies such as having memory being built into the processor itself, lessening fetch times from other memory sources. Another new concept is that of field programmable gate arrays, which can be re-programmed to suit any requirement and paired with traditional chips to provide flexibility and speed up computations. Rapid increases to computing power aside, the future release of 5G network technology means devices will be able to send data with practically unrestricted network traffic. <br /><br />
							Coming back to the topic, whether the data is label or not, continuous/discrete, or supervised/unsupervised methods are employed, it seems we are at a point where the available hardware technology we have is able to extract the most from artificial intelligence methodologies in a multitude of fields.<br /><br />
